Product specification:  
Type number: WTVB01 -BT50 
Description: Bluetooth 5.0 vibration sensor  
1. Product overview  
1, module internal voltage stability circuit, internal equipped with lithium battery, 
3.7V power supply, easy connection.  
2, the use of advanced digital filtering technology, can effectively reduce the 
measurement noise, improve the measurement accuracy.  
3. At the same time, provide various kinds of upper computer, use instructions, 
development manuals required by users, so that the research and development time 
for various needs is reduced to the minimum.  
4, Support Type -C interface, convenient for users to choose the best connection mode. 
Serial port rate 115200bps.  
5. The cut -off frequency is adjustable from 0 to 100Hz, and the detection cycle is 
adjustable from 1 to 100Hz.  
6, three axis displacement, three axis speed, three axis Angle, three axis frequency 
output, to meet the user's vibration and impact comprehensive measurement, judge 
whether the measured object (motor water pump) is damaged. If there is a machine 
fault caused by bearing wear, bearing cracking, poor dynamic balance and moderate 
factors, vibration sensor can detect the fault in advance and put forward an early 
warning, to prevent the machine from continuing to work in bad condition and causing 
damage, thus bringing economic losses.  
7, application field: can be widely used in submersible pump, fan, turbine unit, 
coal mill, system. The bearing vibration measurement and real -time monitoring of 
oxygen machine, generator, centrifuge, compressor, water pump, motor and other 
rotating machinery.

Download from upper computer:  
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TLutidDBd_tDg5aTXgjvkz63OVt5_8ZZ?usp=drive_link  
First, automatic search ： 
1. Search for the sensor model.  
2. Click Search Device and select Bluetooth device WTVB01_BT50.  
 
After successful connection, data can be displayed on the software, as shown in the 
figure below:  


 
Two, manual connection  
Type_C data cable to connect computer  
1. Select the device name.  
2. Select the serial port number.  
3. Set baud rate to 115200,  
4. Click Add.  
 
 
3.3 Curve Chart  


Click on the graph, there are curves of vibration velocity, vibration Angle, 
vibration displacement and temperature (normal mode); In high -speed mode, only the 
vibration displacement curve has data, as shown in the figure below:  
 
 
3.4 Scatter diagram  
In order to obtain the complete vibration displacement scatter diagram, it is 
recommended to use the high -speed mode to view  
 
 
4. Configure the software  
4.1 Restoring Settings  


Click "Configuration", and click "Restore Settings" in the sensor configuration 
interface to restore factory Settings, as shown in the picture below:  
 
4.2 Restart  
Click "Configure", and click "Restart" in the sensor configuration interface to 
restart the sensor, as shown in the figure below:  
 
4.3 Cut-off frequency  
Open "Configuration", click the drop -down menu of "Cutoff frequency" in the sensor 
configuration interface, and select the corresponding cutoff frequency to set the 
cutoff frequency (the default cutoff frequency is 10.0Hz). Our cutoff frequency is 


used in this way (excitation with amplitude sinusoidal signal, constantly changing 
the frequency, the corresponding frequency when the output amplitude decreases to 
0.707 times of the input is the cutoff frequency. The output amplitude is greater 
than or equal to 0.707 times the frequency range of the input amplitude, that is, 
the working frequency range. We can change the cut -off frequency to filter out 
clutter of other frequencies. For example, the frequency of other clutter is 30Hz, 
and the sensor works at 50Hz, so we may as well set the cut -off frequency to 40.0 
and 50.0Hz.  
 
4.4 Detection Cycle  
Open "Configuration", click the drop -down menu of "Detection cycle" in the sensor 
configuration interface, and select the corresponding detection cycle to set the 
detection cycle (the default detection cycle is 100Hz, and the detection cycle can 
be considered as the number of output packets per second), as shown in the figure:
